# Speech_Recognition_Audio_Files
This repo contains a project that reads an audio file and then uses Google Cloud's Speech API to convert the speech data into a string. The project uses Python's SpeechRecognition module to acces Google's Cloud Speech API. Other speech recognition APIs are also available in this library.
